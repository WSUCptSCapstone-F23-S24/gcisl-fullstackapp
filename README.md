## Accounts
Currently we are in the process of moving all exterior services under one gmail account. This will allow future users to be able to access Cobb Connect services without having to contact prior students. We are centralizing all information under the account `wsucobbconnect@gmail.com`. The password for this account is `gocougs!`.
